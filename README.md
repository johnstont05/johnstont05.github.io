## I'm Taylor Johnston.
A data fellow at the <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/">Center for Public Integrity</a>, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom investigating democracy, power and privilege, I am working with the data team to utilize and build upon my skills in journalism, data analysis and design.

This is a portfolio website I made to house all of my projects. Check it out <a href="https://taylorfayjohnston.com/">here</a>!
